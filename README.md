# SURVEY REPORT

### CONCERNING THE UKRAINIAN VACCINATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST RESPIRATORY DISEASE COVID-19 CAUSED BY SARS-COV-2 CORONAVIRUS

Against the backdrop of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a worldwide vaccination campaign is underway, which at the time of writing is the only proven means to mitigate the effects of coronavirus infection. High levels of morbidity lead to increased social tensions, employment problems and, as a consequence, unfavorable economic conditions for the country's development (International Labor Organization, 2021). Compared to European countries, the low rate of vaccination in Ukraine may indicate the existence of systematic miscalculations by the organization of the campaign. As public awareness of vaccination measures is extremely important in the fight against a pandemic, it is important to understand the attitudes of different categories of citizens. A separate destabilizing aspect is the increasing influence of vaccination opponents. Having spent much of his time observing such groups of people, the author observed a significant social demand for conspiracy theories. In order to monitor public sentiment and identify social traits inherent in opponents of vaccination, a survey was conducted involving 2,084 respondents, which were asked to answer 16 questions.
